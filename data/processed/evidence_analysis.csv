FBI Scene Documentation Record,"['FBI', 'Jeffrey Epstein (by association of address)', '9 East 71st St, New York, NY']","Two hands wearing black gloves are visible, holding the document and an object. No faces are visible. No minors are detected.","This document is an FBI record dated July 6, 2019, with case ID 31E-NY-3027571. It records photography being conducted at 9 East 71st St, New York, NY, which is a known residence of Jeffrey Epstein. The photographer's name is redacted.",8,"This document is highly valuable as it establishes official FBI activity (photography) at Jeffrey Epstein's primary New York residence on a specific date. It serves as crucial procedural evidence, confirming law enforcement presence and documentation at a key location in the investigation. This is fundamental for establishing the chain of custody for any physical evidence collected from that site and provides a direct link between the FBI's investigation and Epstein's property.",EFTA00000001_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000001_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:52:07 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in the photograph.,"The document is a photograph of the exterior of a stately building. It features ornate stone architecture, a large arched wooden main door with a prominent lantern, and barred windows. Two trees flank the entrance. A small black service door on the left side of the facade displays multiple 'No Entry' and 'No Trespassing' signs, including text in English and Chinese characters (禁止入内). A document identifier 'EFTA00000002' is present at the bottom right, indicating its inclusion in case files. The specific address or direct link to Jeffrey Epstein is not overtly visible within the image.",6,"This image provides visual documentation of a specific property, which, based on its file identifier (EFTA00000002), is implicitly considered relevant to the Epstein case. While it does not contain direct incriminating evidence, specific individuals, or explicit operational details, it serves as valuable contextual evidence by documenting a location potentially associated with the investigation. Its importance stems from its potential to identify and verify properties linked to the case, offering a tangible backdrop for other pieces of evidence. The lack of explicit information about the location's direct relevance or any discernible activity within the image itself limits it from being a 'smoking gun'.",EFTA00000002_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000002_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:52:32 2026
Photo Evidence,['Jeffrey Epstein'],No identifiable individuals are visible in the photograph. A dark-colored car is parked in front of the building.,"The image depicts the exterior of Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan townhouse, located at 9 East 71st Street. This residence is a central location in the allegations against him.",8,"This document is a photograph of Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan townhouse, which is a known and critical location in the Epstein case, where numerous alleged abuses are said to have taken place. It provides direct visual evidence of a key setting, offering contextual importance to the investigation, even though it doesn't show specific events or individuals.",EFTA00000003_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000003_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:52:57 2026
Photo Evidence,['Jeffrey Epstein'],No people or faces are visible in the image.,"The image displays the initials 'JE' prominently on a stone wall, next to a wooden door. Given the context of the 'Epstein case files', these initials most likely refer to Jeffrey Epstein and could serve as photographic evidence of a location associated with him.",6,"The photo holds moderate importance as it directly links a physical location to Jeffrey Epstein via his initials. While it is not a 'smoking gun' document showing direct illicit activity, it can be crucial for identifying properties, residences, or specific rooms associated with him, which could then be cross-referenced with other evidence, testimonies, or investigative findings. Its value lies in establishing spatial context and confirming associations.",EFTA00000004_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000004_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:53:24 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in this image.,"The image displays the exterior of an entrance to a building or apartment, featuring the number '9' prominently. An electronic keypad intercom system with numerical buttons (1-9, *, #) and a separate call button are visible on the stone wall next to a wooden door. A mezuzah-like object is affixed to the doorframe. This photograph likely serves to identify or document a specific physical location pertinent to the Epstein case.",6,"This photo provides valuable visual evidence of a specific physical location, which is crucial for mapping out properties or residences connected to the Epstein investigation. While it doesn't contain direct incriminating content or individuals, it can be important for corroborating addresses, understanding access points, or verifying the nature of properties used in the case. The presence of a keypad intercom indicates controlled access, and the number '9' could refer to an apartment or building number, making it a key piece of location-specific intelligence.",EFTA00000005_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000005_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:53:52 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in this image.,"The document is a photograph depicting a damaged wooden door. The damage appears to be around the lock and door frame, consistent with a forced entry or an attempt to breach the door. The wood is splintered and broken. The visible lock cylinder has 'medeco' branded on it.",6,"The image provides factual evidence of property damage, specifically a door that appears to have been forced open or attacked. This could be important for establishing a timeline of events, proving a break-in, or demonstrating security breaches relevant to an investigation. However, without further context (e.g., the location of this door, the date the photo was taken, what was behind the door), its direct value as a 'smoking gun' related to the broader Epstein case is limited. It's an important piece of physical evidence documenting a state of an object.",EFTA00000006_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000006_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:54:16 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in the image.,"The document is a photograph depicting a wooden door with significant damage to the frame around the lock mechanism, consistent with a forced entry or attempt to breach the door. The door features brass hardware, including a lock labeled 'modeco' and a decorative woven-style door pull.",6,"This image documents physical damage to a door, suggesting an incident such as a break-in, a search operation, or an attempt to access a secured area. If this door is linked to a property or location directly relevant to the Epstein case, it could serve as important evidence related to a specific event, a crime scene, or potential tampering. The brand 'modeco' on the lock could also potentially aid in identifying the type of lock or its origin. Without specific contextual information about the door's location or the circumstances of the damage, its direct evidential value for identifying persons or specific events is limited, but it points to a significant physical alteration or event.",EFTA00000007_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000007_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:54:42 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in the image.,"The image shows a damaged wooden door frame near the lock mechanism, with significant splintering and breakage of the wood. A brass doorknob is visible on both sides of the door.",6,"This document is a piece of physical evidence, specifically a photograph documenting damage to a door frame. While it does not directly depict individuals or specific actions, such damage could be relevant in an investigation, suggesting forced entry, an attempted break-in, or other significant events at a location pertinent to the case. Its importance relies on the context of which door this is and what event it is associated with within the Epstein case files. Without further context, it's moderately important as documented damage.",EFTA00000008_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000008_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:55:06 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible.,"The document is a photograph displaying significant damage to a wooden door frame, specifically around the area where a lock mechanism is installed. The wood is splintered and broken, suggesting a forced entry or an attempt to forcefully open or compromise the door.",6,"This photo depicts potential physical evidence of a forced entry or an attempt to compromise a secure door. In the context of the Epstein case files, such an image could be highly relevant to investigations concerning security breaches, escape attempts, or the discovery of evidence within properties. Its precise importance depends on the specific context and associated incident it documents, but it inherently suggests an event of forceful interaction with a security barrier.",EFTA00000009_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000009_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:55:27 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No individuals or faces are visible in the photograph.,"The photograph depicts an interior architectural space, likely a grand entryway or hallway. It shows a short flight of stairs leading up to ornate wooden double doors. Large framed landscape paintings hang on the walls flanking the staircase. An umbrella stand is visible to the left of the doors. A small white object, possibly a security camera or sensor, is mounted on the wall above the doors. The specific location is not identified within the image.",3,"The image provides visual documentation of an interior location, which could be a residence or property relevant to the Epstein case. However, it does not depict any individuals, specific events, or direct evidence of illicit activities. Its primary value is contextual, offering a view of a specific site's features and potential security measures (e.g., the camera), which could be useful if the location is definitively identified and linked to other evidence.",EFTA00000010_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000010_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:56:05 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in the image.,"The document is a photograph of a large multi-panel artwork, possibly a Japanese screen or painting, depicting a landscape with a prominent snow-capped mountain (resembling Mount Fuji) and several trees. The artwork is hung on a light-colored brick or stone wall. The document identifier EFTA00000011 suggests it is part of a larger collection of files.",2,"The image depicts a piece of artwork and does not contain any direct textual information, identifiable individuals, or explicit context relevant to the core aspects of the Epstein case (e.g., flight manifests, victim accounts, financial records, or direct evidence of illicit activities). Its primary value, if any, would be circumstantial, possibly indicating decor or an inventory item from a property associated with the case, but it provides no direct evidentiary link on its own.",EFTA00000011_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000011_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:56:25 2026
Exhibit Photo,[],No people or faces are visible in the image.,"The document is a photograph of a multi-panel traditional landscape artwork, possibly a screen or painting, depicting mountains, water, and boats. It appears to be an image of an object, rather than a textual document, potentially from an inventory or evidence collection related to the Epstein case files.",1,"The image displays only an artwork and provides no direct textual information, names, dates, or specific content relevant to the core allegations of the Epstein case. Its evidentiary value, without external context (e.g., details about its ownership, provenance, or connection to specific events), is extremely low. It appears to be an inventory photograph rather than a 'smoking gun' document.",EFTA00000012_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000012_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:57:12 2026
Photographic Evidence,[],No people are visible in the image.,"The document is a photograph of a large, ornate wooden double door with an arched top, set in a stone wall. It is flanked by two large panels displaying traditional landscape paintings. To the right of the door, there are several small, rectangular panels that appear to be part of an intercom system or doorbells. The image provides a visual record of a specific location's entrance.",3,"The image is a photograph of an architectural feature (a door and its surroundings) and does not contain any direct evidence in the form of people, documents, or explicit contextual information related to the Epstein case. Its importance as evidence is currently low, as it relies entirely on external context not provided within the image itself (e.g., if this is proven to be an entrance to a property directly linked to the case or its associates). Without such context, it serves as a generic location photograph.",EFTA00000013_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000013_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:57:34 2026
Photo Evidence,['Bill Clinton'],"A painting of an adult male, widely believed to be Bill Clinton, is visible. No actual people are present; only the artistic depiction.","The photo captures an interior scene featuring a door with an evidence marker 'A' taped to it, and a painting on an adjacent wall. The painting strongly resembles the controversial portrait of Bill Clinton in a blue dress, which was reportedly found in Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan townhouse. This suggests the photo was taken during the documentation or inventory of one of Epstein's properties.",7,"This document is moderately important because it provides visual corroboration of an item (the controversial Bill Clinton painting) that has been publicly associated with Jeffrey Epstein's properties. The presence of an official-looking evidence marker ('A') indicates that this photo was taken as part of an investigation or evidence collection process. While not directly a 'smoking gun' for specific crimes, it helps establish the environment and items found within Epstein's residences, which can support other aspects of the investigation or witness testimonies.",EFTA00000014_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000014_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:57:57 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in this image.,"The document scan is a photograph of an interior room, likely an office or a control room. It features a desk with an office chair, and a significant multi-monitor setup (approximately 12-15 monitors visible) suggesting a complex data monitoring, surveillance, or trading station. Various desk items such as tissues, bottles, and office supplies are present. A painting depicting legs in red high heels hangs on the wall, along with a framed document (text illegible). Electrical equipment is mounted on another wall. The overall impression is a specialized workstation.",5,"The image provides contextual photographic evidence of a specific room, potentially a workspace or control center, associated with the Epstein case files. The extensive multi-monitor setup is unusual and suggests activities requiring significant visual data processing or surveillance, which could be relevant to understanding the operations or environment. However, without further context, specific incriminating details or direct links to crimes or key individuals are not apparent from the image itself. The artistic choice of the painting is also a detail that might be considered notable by investigators, but its direct evidential value is low without further context.",EFTA00000015_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000015_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 22:58:21 2026
Internal Facility Photo,[],No people or faces are visible. The image shows two office chairs positioned at a workstation.,"The image displays an organized, though slightly cluttered, workstation area, possibly a security or monitoring station, indicated by the large array of monitors (at least 7 visible) and wall-mounted control panels/alarms. The presence of personal items (tissues, vitamins, Voss water bottle) suggests it is an actively used workspace. The document ID is EFTA00000016.",3,"This image provides context about the physical environment (likely an office or control room associated with the subject's activities) but does not contain direct textual evidence, named individuals, or incriminating information itself. Its importance is low unless cross-referenced with other evidence showing who used this station or what was being monitored.",EFTA00000016_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000016_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:44:23 2026
Photo Evidence - Office Interior,[],"No clear people or faces are visible. Reflections in the window/mirror on the right show blurred shapes that might be people, but they are indistinct and not identifiable.","This image shows an office workspace, likely from a seizure or investigation, characterized by a large multi-monitor setup (at least 6 screens visible) suggesting intense monitoring or financial trading/data analysis capabilities. Items on the desk include a multi-line telephone, tissues, and office supplies. A door is marked with the letter 'A', and through the doorway on the right, a digital clock reads '7:34' and what appears to be 'SAT 10'.",4,"This is contextual evidence (a photo of an office setup) rather than direct documentary evidence (like a contract or ledger). The multi-screen setup implies activity related to complex operations (e.g., surveillance, finance). However, without knowing the location or what was on the screens, its direct evidentiary value is moderate. The document ID 'EFTA00000017' suggests it is part of an evidence log.",EFTA00000017_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000017_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:44:37 2026
Interior Photograph/Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in the image. It depicts an empty office or room setting.,"The image is a photograph of an interior space, likely an office, showing two office chairs, a small desk or filing cabinet surface with some miscellaneous items (tissue box, supplies), and several doorways. There are no visible documents or people that offer direct intelligence regarding the case beyond establishing location context if this area is known.",2,"The image appears to be a security or evidence photo documenting a physical location (likely an office) mentioned in the case files (indicated by the label 'EFTA00000018'). It contains no textual evidence, faces, or specific items of immediate evidentiary value, hence the low score, though it serves as circumstantial location documentation.",EFTA00000018_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000018_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:44:52 2026
Maintenance/Service Log Excerpt,['J. Epstein'],No people or faces are visible; the document is a table of service records.,"This document appears to be a log or record of maintenance services (Water Treatment, Tower Cleaning, Legionella Tests, Inspections) performed for the client 'Merwin Dela Cruz - J. Epstein' between April 2018 and December 2018, primarily focusing on cooling towers.",6,"The document directly links J. Epstein (presumably Jeffrey Epstein) to recurring maintenance services at a location, including specific tests for Legionella. This establishes a timeline of business activity associated with him, which is moderately relevant in general case files, but it is not a direct communication or evidence of wrongdoing. The presence of service dates spanning most of 2018 adds contextual weight.",EFTA00000019_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000019_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:45:20 2026
Evidence Photo (Server Rack/Office Equipment),['Epstein'],No people or faces are visible in this image. It depicts electronic equipment and miscellaneous objects.,"The image shows an open server rack containing various networked devices (switches, servers, possibly DVRs/NVRs) which likely stored critical digital data. Objects on top include a 'MARSHAL' helmet, a bottle of cologne/perfume, hand sanitizer, remote controls, and a large television monitor. The presence of a dedicated server rack suggests a significant local data storage or surveillance system.",8,"This is highly important evidence as it documents the physical seizure of data storage hardware from a location associated with Epstein. The server rack contents (servers, networking gear) are critical for forensic analysis of communications, records, or potentially video surveillance related to the case. The contextual items on top (like the helmet) might offer further clues about the owner/user of the space.",EFTA00000020_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000020_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:45:36 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in this image. It depicts a cluttered storage closet or utility space.,"The image shows a utility closet or small storage area, possibly in a residence or hotel room, containing various tools (like a drill), boxes, cleaning supplies, and an open ceiling access panel with visible ductwork/wiring. The presence of tools and the open ceiling access might suggest maintenance, covert installation, or evidence of ongoing work/alterations.",3,"This image likely documents the condition or contents of a specific room seized as evidence (indicated by the EFTA timestamp). However, as a standalone photograph of a cluttered storage area with generic tools and boxes, its immediate significance to the core case narrative is low unless the specific items found (e.g., in the boxes, or the nature of the access panel) are later linked to illegal activity.",EFTA00000021_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000021_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:45:52 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in the image.,"The image is an interior photograph showing an open doorway leading to a small area. Visible items include a black rolling tool chest or cabinet stacked with small cases (possibly containing electronics or small equipment), a grey utility/electrical panel cover on the wall, and a white plastic shopping bag on the striped carpet. The bag has partial branding visible: ""DUA...e by ...gre"". The presence of a utility panel and tool storage might suggest this is a utility closet or storage space, but the specific contents are unclear.",2,"The image depicts a mundane interior space (a closet or small alcove) with generic items like a tool chest and a utility panel. While it is cataloged evidence (EFTA00000022), the visible content itself offers very low direct intelligence regarding criminal activity without further context about what might be stored in the cases or behind the panel.",EFTA00000022_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000022_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:46:07 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in this image. It depicts an interior space corner with objects placed near an open door.,"The image shows a corner area near an open door, revealing a collection of miscellaneous items including a crowbar leaning against the frame, a TEKBOX LARRYS APT 301 amplified indoor flat HDTV antenna box, a small red fire extinguisher (appearing used or marked), and a large black toolbox/cabinet.",3,"This is likely evidence documentation of items found in a specific location related to the case (perhaps seized items or contents of a room). The objects themselves—a crowbar, an antenna box, and a fire extinguisher—are generally mundane, but their presence or condition might be relevant to the context of the property being searched or utilized. It's low to moderate value unless the specific brand/model or placement is contextually significant.",EFTA00000023_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000023_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:46:21 2026
Photo Evidence,[],No people or faces are visible in this image. It is a photograph of an interior bathroom.,"The image displays an interior view of a small, white bathroom, showing a pedestal sink, a toilet, and the edge of a shower stall. A reflection in the mirror above the sink shows a light fixture and a clothes hanger, suggesting this might be a hotel or private room bathroom. The file number EFTA00000024 is visible at the bottom.",2,"This is a low-importance piece of evidence, likely cataloging the interior state of a location (like a residence or hotel room). It contains no identifiable persons, explicit evidence, or textual data related to the case, only establishing a setting.",EFTA00000024_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000024_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:46:34 2026

It depicts an interior storage area.,"The image shows a storage area with shelving containing various unidentified objects, including what appears to be large green glass/plastic chunks, black foam blocks, and bags. Notably, there is a wall-mounted file organizer with labels referencing initials/names: GSJ, LSJ, ZORRO, PB, and PARIS, suggesting an organizational or communication system tied to specific individuals or projects.",5,"The image itself is mundane (a storage closet), lowering the score. However, the presence of labeled files/pockets (GSJ, LSJ, ZORRO, PB, PARIS) directly links this location to entities or communications relevant to the case files, significantly increasing its value as circumstantial evidence regarding logistics or personnel associated with the locations or activities.",EFTA00000028_page_1.jpg,data/images/documents/EFTA00000028_page_1.jpg,Sun Feb 22 23:49:50 2026
